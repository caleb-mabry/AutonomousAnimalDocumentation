            <h1>What is Autonomous Animal?</h1>
            <p>Autonomous Animal is a bot that was made from the heart and soul of the animal crossing community. Ever
                since being indebbted to Nook, the community has been looking for a way to break free from crippling
                debt. Thankfully, with the help of the Autonomous Animal and your community, we can do this together.
            </p>
            <p>The Autonomous Animal works like any other faithful pet you have ever had. The Autonomous Animal is
                always here to listen for your communities prices. Simply tell the Autonomous Animal a command from his
                trick book and he will promptly output the appropriate response! Since the Autonomous Animal is still
                very young, his trainers are looking for wonderful feedback from the community.
